          Canova's assistants roughly blocked out the marble, leaving Canova to
          perform the final carving and shape the stone to highlight the Graces
          soft flesh. This was a trademark of the artist, and the piece shows a
          strong allegiance to the Neo-Classical movement in sculpture, of which
          Canova is the prime exponent. <br /> <br /> The three goddesses are
          shown nude, huddled together, their heads almost touching in what many
          have referred to as an erotically charged piece. They stand, leaning
          slightly inward â€” perhaps discussing a common issue, or simply
          enjoying their closeness. Their hair-styles are similar, braided atop
          their heads.

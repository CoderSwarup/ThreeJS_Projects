                Euphrosyne is a Goddess of Good Cheer, Joy and Mirth. Her name
                is the female version of a Greek word euphrosynos, which means
                "merriment". The Greek poet Pindar states that these goddesses
                were created to fill the world with pleasant moments and good
                will. Usually the Charites attended the goddess of beauty
                Aphrodite.
